### Experimental I/O tools to run distributed R jobs seamlessly and handle chunk-wise data processing.

**Please see <http://RForge.net/iotools> for documentation, binaries, etc.**

NOTE: Unlike most of my other packages on RForge.net, this package is **experimental** and
the API may change without a warning.

It is mainly meant to explore concepts which may then move to other packages
(e.g., some functions have already moved to [unixtools](http://rforge.net/unixtools) and
[fastmatch](http://rforge.net/fastmatch)).
